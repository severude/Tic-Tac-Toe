Congratulations, it's a great project. I liked reviewing it. The computer player algorithm is pretty easy to beat but it's straight forward and doesn't use a random function, which I found original and simple. The code is very well organized and easy to read. It's all based on events. The only thing i could suggest for an upgrade as adding some delay so that the computer feels more human and I can see its last move in the very unlikely occurence where it would beat me :) ! Keep up !
